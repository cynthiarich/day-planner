### How to use it

This web app uses local storage to keep track of the items you've included on your day planner. It contains the following features:

- Subtle highlighting to indicate which events in the past, present, and future
- Simply input the event/task and press Save (or not, your events will automatically be saved when you move between dates)
- To remove an event/task, simply delete it and click Save

### Tools used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)

### Future Development Opportunities

This is an MVP project. Future iteration could include some of the following capabilities:

- Give the user the ability to indicate start/stop times
- Give the user the ability to create time blocks < 1 hour
- Provide a timer so the user can see how long was actually spent on each task
- Give the user the ability to "forward" tasks they didn't complete to the next empty block on their schedule
- Give the user the ability to reorder tasks
- Integrate with calendar apps to automatically block off times for meetings
